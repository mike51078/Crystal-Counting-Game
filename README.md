Crystal Counting Game

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the bottom of the page.  The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game, which is the target score.  When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score as the player clicks on each crystal. This number will not be displayed and will change with each game.

The game ends when the player either wins by matching the target score, or loses by exceeding the target score.  The game will then restart, and the user's total score will reset to zero.
